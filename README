HtmlTable
=========

A HtmlTable plugin that should easily tie in w/ authz routines (eg cancan).

It has 1 class & module: Formatter and Helpers.

Helpers provides #html_table_for and takes a collection and options hash as its only args.

Table columns must be based on db columns or AR associations/aggregations right now but translating eg Name => Group or Children => Sub-Groups is possible and by default any protected attributes are not shown in html ('id','type' by def. for all objects).
Using the Reflections module from Rails I was able to get a list of associations/aggregations.

Todo
====

test Helpers module
add the ability to add custom table columns
? get management links to show in own column

Example
=======

Columns can be blacklisted when html_table_for is called, eg: 
:blacklist => ['Groups','Registered Memberships'].

Links to actions can also be blacklisted eg:
:edit_group_path => {
  :blacklisted => false, # can? :update, Group
  :use_obj => true,
  :options => {
     :class => 'fake_button'
  }
}
